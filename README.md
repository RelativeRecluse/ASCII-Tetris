# ASCII Tetris in C (Version 1)

This program is a functional Tetris clone with all the expected features, coded in C using ASCII characters for graphics.

## Features

- Full gameplay including piece rotation, line clearing, and score tracking  
- Text-based interface using ASCII characters  
- Developed as a personal project to sharpen C programming skills and deepen understanding of game development and logic

## Prerequisites

- Windows OS  
- GCC or any C compiler  
- Terminal/Command Prompt to run the executable

## How to Run the Game

Download the "ASCIITetris" folder from this repository and double-click the `runTetris.bat` file via your Terminal/Command Prompt or through your C compiler.

## Controls and How to Play

- Use the **A** and **D** keys to move the active piece left and right  
- Press **R** to rotate the active piece  
- Hold **S** to increase the falling speed for quick placement  
- As of version 1, there are no levels or increasing difficulty. The goal is to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score through line clears.

## Project Status

The original goal was to recreate the NES/Game Boy using only ASCII characters for graphucs. As the project grew in complexity, it shifted focus to a programming exercise. The core mechanics are solid and the game is functional. I may return later to pursue the original goal.
